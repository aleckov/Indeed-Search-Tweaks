# Indeed-Search-Tweaks

Apparently Indeed does not support Boolean operators for location search, thus making it impossible to search for jobs in several specific cities/states at once. This script attempts to fix that by suppressing any search results outside of the desired locations. With this, a search over a wide area (e.g. "United States") will only show jobs in specific parts.

Also, the script changes the background color of sponsored jobs, making it easier to distinguish them from the actual search results.
